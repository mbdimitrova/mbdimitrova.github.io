I'm a software engineer with B.S. in Informatics and M.S. in Bioinfomatics from "St. Kliment Ohridski" University of Sofia. Currently specialising in backend web development, I'm proficient in Ruby and Python. I enjoy solving complex problems, improving existing systems and learning new things.


Apart from software development, I am interested in low waste / sustainability, succulents, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/spiralnegative/">film photography</a> and baking.
