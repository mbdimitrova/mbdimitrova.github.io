On my last birthday I decided to start a [1 Second Everyday](http://1se.co/) project - a video composed of 1 second videos taken every day for a year. This became some sort of a visual diary capturing random moments of my life at 25.

### The app
The 1SE application has a really nice interface and does what it is supposed to do - clip and store your videos on a timeline. It comes with nice additions like reminders and backup. 

_Note: in the current version 2.5.4 for Android there is a problem with the clipping and compiling with some devices which can be fixed by turning off the **Hardware compile** option in the Settings._

### Thanks
Big thanks to my SO who gave me interesting ideas, did the video compressing and added some cool music to the final video. Also, thanks to all of you who are in this video ^^
