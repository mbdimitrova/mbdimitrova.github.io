It was high time I started [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator in Ruby, was exactly what I needed. It converts raw text files in various formats and generates a complete, static website. All of the content is hosted and version-controlled on [GitHub](https://github.com/mbdimitrova/mbdimitrova.github.io). Basically, I write my posts in Markdown using my test editor of choice, VIm, then I commit and push to Github. Awesome, right?

Ready, Set, Go!
