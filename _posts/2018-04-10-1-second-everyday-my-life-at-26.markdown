The time has come for a new [1 Second Everyday](http://1se.co/) video.

### FAQ
**Don't you get bored of making this?**
No, I really love the final result and making a video everyday has become some sort of a habbit.

**Don't you ever forget to make a video for the day?**
To be honest, there were a couple of uneventful but quite busy days when I just didn't find the time to make a video. That's why I made one on the next day, doing something that I had done the previous day (commuting, making a cup of tea, etc.)

**Where do you find motivation/ideas?**
While there are days so full of events that I find it hard to choose one video only, there are also pretty dull days. And that's okay - just make a video of something trivial. Someone you meet, something you cook or eat, something beautiful - it doesn't matter as long as it makes you smile.

**How did you add music?**
After compiling the final video in the app, you can use any video editing program. I used _Adobe Premiere Pro_.

**Will you continue making this?**
Absolutely - in fact, another one is in progress.
